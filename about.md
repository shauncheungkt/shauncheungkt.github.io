  Hey there! I am Shaun and I am currently doing a transition towards data analytics. This blog is created for me to share what I have done in this field.

## My Story so far...

I studied Accounting and Finance at the Australian National University. After 6 years of sales and trading experience involving both retail and B2B clients, I have decided to take on a new path to impact sales and customer satisfaction through analytics. This decision has been influenced by my experience in trading, where I have to identify hidden pattern in price movement to make actionable decisions. I would like to apply the same concept to business data to produce actionable insights to impact business and customer satisfaction.   

Thanks for reading!
